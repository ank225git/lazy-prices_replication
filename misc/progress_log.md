Switching to "document dictionaries per this report feedback:

```
Things that make estimating similarities easier:

Instead of the 50GB zip file (which is the text in the reports), I used the "document dictionaries" file here: https://sraf.nd.edu/sec-edgar-data/ It's only 15GB (not even zipped), and it already has the word counts, which is all you need for cosine and jaccard similarities. There's a few challenges involved in using it, but I think it's a lot easier than the 50GB approach.
I also used the 10X Summaries: 1993-2024 file while doing this, but it might be unnecessary.
